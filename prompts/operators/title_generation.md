# Title Generation – 9 Operators, Marketing Operator, Finance Operator

Your goal is to create a **short, specific title** for the following insight. The user should understand what the insight is about from the title alone.

## Guidelines

- A generic title is the enemy. Use the unique wording of the insight to form the title.
- Do **not** include "the" at the start. (e.g. "Importance of Being Early" not "The Importance of Being Early".)
- Use **active voice**. (e.g. "Being Early Is Important" or "CAC Payback Under 6 Months".)
- Do **not** use adverbs.
- Wrap your title in `<title>` tags. Example: `<title>CAC Payback Under 6 Months</title>`

## Operators-style examples

- From a unit-economics insight: `<title>CAC Payback Under 6 Months</title>`
- From a framework: `<title>Creative Testing Cadence at Hexclad</title>`
- From a POV: `<title>When to Hire a CMO</title>`
- From a business idea: `<title>UGC Studio as a Service</title>`
- From a story: `<title>Ridge's REI Retail Pitch</title>`
- From a product: `<title>Northbeam for MMM</title>`
- From a POV: `<title>Brand Spend at 10% After $50M</title>`
- (Structure only) From MFM-style: `<title>Employees Show Greatness Early</title>`
